# Catalog App
## overview
This website implements CRUD operations, it's a catalog that contains categories and their elements.

## What is needed to run this app
# Installing the Vagrant VM
you will need the Vagrant software to configure and manage the VM. Here are the tools you'll need to install to get it running:
# Git
If you don't already have Git installed, download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), Install the version for your operating system.
On Windows, Git will provide you with a Unix-style terminal and shell (Git Bash). (On Mac or Linux systems you can use the regular terminal program).
You will need Git to install the configuration for the VM. If you'd like to learn more about Git, take a look at [this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)

# VirtualBox
VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the VM. you can download it from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it.

_Ubuntu 14.04 Note_: If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center, not the `virtualbox.org` web site. Due to a [reported bug](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2227131), installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.

# Vagrant
Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem, you can download it from [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Install the version for your operating system.

`windows OS note:` The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.

# Fetch the Source Code and VM Configuration
`Windows:`  Use the Git Bash program (installed with Git) to get a Unix-style terminal.

`other systems:` Use your favorite terminal program.

# Fork the starter repo
